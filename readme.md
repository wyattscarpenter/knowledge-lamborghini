# Knowledge Lamborghini

_"But you know what I like a lot more than knowledge? Knowledge."_

This is Knowledge Lamborghini ("KL"), an eclectic discord bot with exactly these features:

* NO special sigil, all commands are invoked as they are written here. All commands are case-insensitive.
* NO versioning, uptime, or stability guarantees. I keep the version number at 0.1.0 and commit broken features directly to master as I work on them. I may or may not have the bot running at any given time.

* Type "think!" and kl will begin to recite the book located in text.json, one unit per hour in the channel in which you made the command. "stop!" will cease the madness.
* Type a phrase that's something like "who's that pokemon?" and kl will post an image from wikimedia for you to guess the name of.
* Using the power of NiceDice, kl will interpret any message consisting solely of a dnd-style dice expression, generate random numbers to simulate dice rolls, and output the result.
* Type `set [word] [response message]` and kl will respond with the response message when the word is posted in chat.
* Reddit link "oldification": links to reddit.com pages will be immediately reposted as links to old.reddit.com pages.
* Planned feature: KL will display the time in a given timezone.

* The code is public domain under CC0 1.0.
* KL's icon is https://i.redd.it/1v4zaf534i851.jpg or best equivalent.
* KL's motto is derivative of YouTube Poops of "Here in My Garage" by Tai Lopez.
